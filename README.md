KubeloxAPI
==========

Kubelox API is a [Bukkit](https://github.com/Bukkit/CraftBukkit) plugin that serves no purpose on it's own.
It's purpose is to serve as a reference point for other plugins in the [Kubelox](http://www.kubelox.com) library.

Other KubeloxAPI dervived plugins will NOT work (or load at all) without the API being present.

Upon the KubeloxAPI being at a successfully working stage, with a good amount of library plugins, we will be opening Pull Requests for everyone where we will except contributions.

All people who contribute a decent amount towards the Kubelox project will get a special rank on and around the Kubelox network.
